# Sales Forecasting
Forecast sales data and comparing forecasting models such as moving average, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA. 
The analysis was conducted to determine the sales forecast in the next 5 years. The data used is a superstore dataset, 
containing sales data from 2014 to 2017. Forecasting is done based on sales history, not forecasting based on certain variables.

Based on the pattern of the data, we choose the best model that can predict the data with least error. From the analysis we know that ARIMA model is the best to forecast stationary with seasonal and trend data. This graph below shows forecasting result using ARIMA model.
